# Terms of Service (Preview)

Welcome to the Global Wealth & Freedom application (“Service”). By creating an account or using the Service you agree to the following foundational terms:

1. Self-custody: you retain direct control of your blockchain accounts. We never take possession of private keys or assets.
2. Eligibility: you confirm that you may legally use the Service in your jurisdiction and that you are not prohibited from interacting with the listed financial partners.
3. Educational nature: model projections and advisor output are illustrative and are **not** individualized investment, tax, or legal advice.
4. Risks: on-chain interactions involve smart-contract risk, price volatility, slippage, and potential loss of capital. Fiat rails are provided by third parties with their own terms.
5. Compliance: you agree to provide accurate information for required KYC/AML screening and to use the Service only for lawful purposes.

The full legal agreement will be delivered prior to public beta launch.***
