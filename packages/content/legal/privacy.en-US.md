# Privacy Notice (Preview)

We collect the minimum data required to operate regulated money movement and to personalize your financial plan:

- Authentication identifiers from Coinbase CDP (email + pseudonymous wallet).
- Funding preferences, rule configurations, and device metadata for security monitoring.
- Aggregated position data sourced from the blockchain and trusted providers.

We do **not** store raw identity documents on our infrastructure. When regulators require verification we rely on zero-knowledge attestations provided by approved partners. Data is encrypted at rest, access logged, and removed when no longer needed for compliance.***
